            > reproduce

        -   Josh: setId call includes DB check. Turns into large queries
            > for images with many files. Might need to reproduce with
            > large DB + large filesets

        -   Possible for the issue to show up in the case of HCS data

            > but will be shut down after June. Need to handle the
            > migration ourselves

                > possible to maintain a full copy

            -   SImon: could free more space in UoD (\~100TB). Need to
