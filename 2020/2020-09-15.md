(2-3 minutes each)

-   IDR:

    -   Release planned for end of month.

        -   1 screen in and ready

        -   2 more studies planned. Both in progress: idr0089 and
            > idr0094 (big covid screen)

        -   Some data missing from idr0094. Lots of compounds handling.

        -   Using [<u>PubChem</u>](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
            > identifiers as standard. Some cleanup needed after
            > publication

        -   First submission using OME-TIFF for HCS data. Bigger example
            > to follow…

        -   Lots of challenges with e.g. 1TB of data.

        -   Jason: idr0094 - first phenotypic screen of covid infection
            > in Human cells with drugs.

        -   Chemical annotation is challenging. Commercial compound
            > library.

        -   EMBL (ChEMBL?) also involved

        -   JM: we are encouraged to use this open data for training
