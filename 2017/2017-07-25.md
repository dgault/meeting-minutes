\[Metadata\]([<u>https://trello.com/c/XQXwX6jj/6-metadata</u>](https://trello.com/c/XQXwX6jj/6-metadata))

\- Simon: testing this morning went well (better than last week) using
public session cache enabled to share a single session between all
public users.

\- Pushed to staging server

\- Do we keep testing idr-testing server without that fix?

\- 5.3 deletion taking too long - hibernate performance

\- 5.3 deletion has functionality for auto-deleting orphaned annotations
etc.

\- Eleanor: use prod42 server for testing instead.

\- Simon: problems with IDR ci just now (can’t build)

\- Chris: expose usage of public session cache?

\- Simon: this is safe to use on fully public server, but this is a
limited use-case

\- Check with Josh when he’s back, prior to release

\- Eleanor: new plates for IDR-16 and new data

\- Balaji/Jason: Notebooks - Gene Ontology queries wrt phenotypes looks
interesting
