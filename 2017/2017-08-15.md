\[Files/Formats\](https://trello.com/b/IBHfAIMP/bio-formats-5-x)/\[OME
Files\](https://trello.com/b/WFYWCvoV/ome-files-0-4-0)

\- BioFormats release. 5.6.0

\- Few PRs open later today to update downstream usage

\- Formats meeting this week to discuss next steps

1\. \[Metadata\](https://trello.com/c/XQXwX6jj/6-metadata)

\- IDR 4.3 plan. Data ready for releasing but a few bugs still to fix

\- Could delay release or just release data but not code?

\- Balaji: Notebooks - running on 30 different complexes, looking at
genes wrt GO

\- PR for IDR py.

1\. \[OMERO 5.4.0\](https://trello.com/b/SiqOu2Bl/omero-540)

\- Mark: Petr discovered \[security vulnerability for light
admins\](https://trello.com/c/7xa7ggwp/111-bug-every-light-admin-can-upload-script)

\- does \*not\* affect OMERO 5.3

\- light admins could work with official scripts without
\`WriteScriptRepo\`

\- now fixed bug and adjusted the test that ought to have checked this

\- Mark: performance of \[deletion with heavily linked
annotations\](https://trello.com/c/mfW0N1an/89-poor-performance-when-deleting-many-one-annotation-links)

\- severely affects IDR data management workflows

\- speculative fixes did not help

\- culprit: previous testing suggested Hibernate's caching

\- would like to confirm but difficult to profile server under
sufficiently heavy load

\- our Hibernate is several years old

\- there is reason to expect better from newer Hibernate

\- culprit: database trigger for reindexing

\- slowest part is a fix for an even worse performance issue

\- move to Elasticsearch may make trigger unnecessary

\- for 5.4.0 planning a workaround

\- 5.3 automatically deleting orphaned comments, etc. makes sense as a
default

\- find a way to extend server API to block orphan checks enough to
return to 5.2 performance

\- should be quite feasible

\- IDR scripts could then activate workaround as needed

\- Mark: \[poorer server
performance\](https://trello.com/c/HvCCqu5z/76-db-writing-performance-testing)
under concurrent write operations

\- reproducible via concurrent imports or moves

\- have not tested concurrent read operations

\- suspicious of \`\_current\_admin\_privileges\` database table

\- possibly overengineered when fixing earlier issues with flakiness

\- Josh is reviewing the approach

\- can try again to aim for transaction-local table entries

\- however, Petr found \`postgres\` processes not consuming much CPU

\- plan to profile \`ome.security.basic.\*\` to see if Petr missed any
smoking guns

\- not yet confidently identified any promising solution

\- JRS: longer-term interest to upgrade Hibernate or get 5.4 out?

\- Hibernate upgrade likely to take a while

\- Dependent on replacing search

1\. \[Outreach\](https://trello.com/b/Da6OAWam/outreach)

\- Cambridge December discussion - Gaby to start gdoc for advertising
course

> \- 2 day course - each day independent. Day 2 advanced

\- ...

1\. Other releases/upgrades:

1\. Figure & iViewer

\- ROI functionality in iViewer. Shape dimensions/stats.

\- Some code might need to be moved down to server (new microservice in
future)?

\- FPBioimage discussion with Michael - e.g. ROI support (cropping)

1\. new website

\- Seb: No active changes just now

\- Secvuln pages migration from old site to new

\- Other content & resourses. Movies, Training etc.

\- Kenny: site support url redirects. No www.legacy...

1\. Sysadmin (current board and recent PRs)

\- Trout re-imaging: Issues with disks. Carp (VM) to be replacement

\-

1\. Glencoe Update: Chris

\- Masks support in OMERO.web and pathviewer

\- Few existing issues. Colour mapping & display

\- Also rendering and handling pngs

\- Masks are ‘full image’ in use cases (very large X and Y sizes)

\- Tiling of masks needed

\- Rendering engine fixes to go into 5.4.0 possibly?

1\. AOB (5 mins max - technical discussions should be highlighted to
relevant people and rescheduled)

> \- Upgrade latest git etc (secvuln fix)
