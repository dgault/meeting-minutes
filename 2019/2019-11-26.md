1. Accepting minutes from [<u>last meeting</u>](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TndXeC3wQSZVEaB5ZGpEAaPRl1QAufSI)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Project Status
-----------------

(2-3 minutes each)

-   IDR (Seb)

    -   Data availability and archival updates.

        -   Solution working for most use-cases, but could be improved
            > in future

    -   Prod72 updates

        -   Last release for this year.

        -   Currently loading, rendering, annotating.

        -   2 experiments to be completed this week for review when
            > Frances back

-   Python3: table for demo (see below)

    -   Post-demo (training + idr)

        -   Generally state of the software

    -   Operating systems

        -   Recommended platforms: Ubuntu 18.04, CentOS 7

        -   Some work on Debian, Ubuntu 16.0.4 but not recommended

    -   Next steps

        -   Requirements page updated

        -   Copy of documentation to be published

        -   Using some pre-releases probably. If comfortable, getting
            > omero-py 5.6.0 released next week

        -   Chris: installation process? Pip vs bundle?

            -   Web should be fully pip-installable, barring
                > configuration variable

            -   Server easier to download as a whole bundle at the
                > moment

        -   Question of dropping Python from the bundle

            -   Main downside is which plugins would be picked up
                > (lib/python vs pip installed component)

        -   Tests only covering Python 3.6

            -   Not possible to run them in Travis (other Python)
                > primarily for memory reasons

-   SA (learning/mail): N/A

-   Glencoe (Chris)

    -   Mrxs repo updates - more generic. Renamed
        > [<u>bioformats2raw</u>](https://github.com/glencoesoftware/bioformats2raw)

        -   Various WSI formats supported -&gt; OME-TIFF

        -   High-performance, multi-threaded, supports downsampling.

        -   Can add more readers in future as needed

        -   Preparing announcement - next week - 10 days

        -   Could be used for pyramid generation in future - not tested
            > yet

    -   Requests for admin tool improvements for managing large number
        > of users.

        -   Lots of groups and users - many have left.

-   Community

    -   JRS: feedback from the road

        -   **Folders**: defining the actual requirement. Some
            > appreciation of what is currently available. Lots of note
            > taking around mapr, etc.

            -   JRS: Also just a matter of working with the metadata.

            -   Will: requires reading the manual which probably isn’t
                > the norm.
