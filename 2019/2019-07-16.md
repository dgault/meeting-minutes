        > likely to rear its head as the academic year progresses and
        > many students sign on. Legacy server now reporting some
        > hardware errors. Paul pleased with UX improvements in
        > switching to current OMERO.iviewer.

    -   Paul may actively promote the server to new groups which may
        > lead to an unexpectedly large increase in numbers of users

            > (IDR) already expressed

        -   Format:

            -   Physical Rooms?

            -   Desks in CTIR2, Breakout Rooms, 1-2 invited talks

                -   Use Google Doc to define topics.

                -   Invite all to Slack in advance

                -   If we don’t book rooms we’re limited by number of
                    > free desks

            -   Fewer presentations, more interactive topics driven by
                > participants

                -   Works for 1 or 2 people, if more may want a room
                    > with presentations instead. Need advance input
                    > from participants so can decide format of each
                    > topic.

            -   General consensus: keep it informal, use desks. Limited
                > to maybe 10 people? Ensure participants say what they
                > want in advance.

    -   Review openmicroscopy.org website, should we be publicising
