2. Project Status
-----------------

(2-3 minutes each)

-   Data-In

    -   Dom: More HPA EBI uploads

        -   Someone other than Dom will import the next HPA dataset.
            > Maybe.

    -   David: BF 6 release in progress, official release next Monday

-   Data-Out

    -   Will: Iviewer: ROI pagination work. When ready we will release
        > 0.7.0

        -   Tiled-based loading is impractical due to lack of spatial
            > querying

        -   ROI table pagination but it’s complicated with big images

        -   See
            > [<u>https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/webclient/?show=project-503</u>](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/webclient/?show=project-503)
            > for IDR ROI example

    -   Build:

        -   JM: Slow progress on ice 37:

            -   slice generated.

            -   Upgraded path.

            -   Not all Java classes are generated

            -   May not make internal 5.5 milestone

        -   Mark: Slow progress on indexer issue.

            -   Simple indexer replacement works only by avoiding
                > Spring: manual session and transaction management, no
                > use of services, so best considered a short-term
                > workaround. Needs more work to properly index data as
                > done by previous indexer but lower technical risk than
                > finally figuring out Spring issue.

        -   Josh: How much would it cost to move to ElasticSearch?

            -   Chris: depends on whether we replicate existing indexing
                > or do something better, JSON only, how would it be
                > deployed and integrated? Needs investigation.

-   Glencoe

    -   Chris: All required backbone services are on Hazelcast, async
        > work ongoing. Something’s broken with 5.4.10.

-   Community

    -   Josh: Sysadmin fires

        -   GPFS outage over weekend

        -   Artifactory delete problems as usual

        -   Outage caused by possible spidering of image downloads

        -   Current workload may be untenable

    -   HCA Report ([<u>Breakout
        > summaries</u>](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xpiochfjuBQOGTvNo4K1_jpsIZ3fhr8Wiw4-rbEUl5Q/edit#slide=id.g4eb0ccbed8_0_16))

        -   Jason: single cell sequencing, data is hosted on AWS and
            > GCP.

            -   Problem: Data egress costs are too expensive to download
                > so all processing has to be done remotely

            -   Could be worse.

        -   Josh: Issues identified with imaging:

            -   Ingest: 1000 file limit

            -   Download: directories stripped

            -   API: S3 access of “blobs”

            -   Problems with lack of deduplication when downloading

        -   General interest; dataset added over the weekend

        -   Next meeting in June

    -   Learning Upgrade?

        -   Jason: Used by a surprisingly number of courses and people.
            > Upgrade requires funding.

    -   Dundee OMERO Workshops

        -   Proposed dates for Users Training

            -   April 8-9; June 10-11.
