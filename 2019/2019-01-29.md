-   Data-In

    -   Jason: TB-scale Data Import

        -   Large imports block OMERO from reliably doing anything else,
            > e.g. importing an IDR HPA dataset (several TB,
            > 10<sup>5</sup>-10<sup>6</sup> images) monopolises OMERO
            > for 1-2 weeks.

        -   Several other examples from users wanting to make bulk
            > queries to OMERO, or wanting to query and modify millions
            > of objects.

        -   Chris: Several customers with toxicology HCS: 1536 wells and
            > multiple fields.

    -   Idr0050: Temporary unicode problems (OMERO.tables/CSV have
        > limited unicode support)

            -   Aiming to release BF 6.0.0 mid-February

-   Data-Out

    -   5.4.11 (Seb)

        -   Insight was fixed in 5.4.10, command line importer is still
            > broken with latest Java release. Fix also added a new
            > client dependency (guava) which wasn’t documented.

        -   Current command line importer workaround in 5.4.10: disable
            > upgrade check/

        -   Decision: release a fix in 5.4.11 or wait for 5.5.0?

            -   Probably wait for 5.5.0 to save time, PR can be
                > backported to the IDR branch.

            -   Chris: Glencoe has workaround for client dependency so
                > release not critical, but everyone should take care
                > before adding new imports to clients.

                -   Should be added to docs and community should be
                    > notified.

                -   Josh/Mark: At some point will add a check to prevent
                    > this happening in future.

            -   Review in 1-2 weeks after 5.5 build issues are fixed.

    -   5.5 Build (JM):

        -   Server up and running before migration of config files.

        -   Moving configuration files to the correct location has
            > required more work than expected. Trying to get the server
            > running again as quickly as possible, but anticipate tests
            > should already pass.

        -   Still need to work on Ice 3.7.
