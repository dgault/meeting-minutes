-----------------

(2-3 minutes each)

-   Data-In (Ingest)

    -   IDR (Prod70) in good shape

        -   Software upgraded and Bio-Formats cache files regenerated

        -   New OMERO 5.5 functionalities available e.g. websockets

            -   J-M: important concept in-place for next-gen VAE
                > proposal (mybinder)

            -   Dominik has PR for Java Gateway using websockets

        -   Restarted thumbnail generation of idr0022 big screen,
            > finalizing annotations.

    -   IDR metadata: authorship discussion

        -   Standardizing author formatting using MEDLINE/Pubmed style

        -   Next: modelling of study vs publication authorship - e.g. 1
            > Study -&gt; 2 Publications

        -   Jason: Use Pubmed-central or Europe PMC style formatting?

            -   Seb: All studies are on Pubmed, but not for PMC or
                > Europe PMC

-   Data-Out (UI/Search)

    -   Prepared for iviewer release - movie, changelog etc - release
        > tomorrow

    -   Docs - Training guides. Use separate repo for each guide. E.g.
        > cellprofiller, fiji etc

        -   Use readthedocs for easy deployment

        -   Each repo is a submodule - separate repos allow different
            > configs for myBinder

        -   Combined into a single omero-guide repo / front page, index
            > etc.

        -   Josh: Usage statistics?

            -   JM: No, not out of the box

            -   Jason: is important for the project. Use e.g. google
                > analytics (don’t write our own)

-   Python3 (Josh)

    -   omero-web still stuck on various manage.py-style errors

        -   Need help with hard-coded assumptions, structuring, internal

    -   omero-py testing strategy fairly sound

    -   Decoupling of OmeroPy - all PRs excluded.

        -   Jobs to merge decoupled repos and run tests

    -   PR to remove from openmicroscopy on its way

    -   JM: submodules? Scripts?

        -   PRs won’t get merged till jobs updated

-   SA (learning/mail)

    -   Seb: starting to archive old services. E.g Trac -&gt; readonly.
        > Need to decide what we want to keep. E.g. many versions of
        > trac pages?

            > (cf. Parade)

            -   Click on ROI - show in table and vice versa

            -   Can we try to get and IDR dataset into a BDV file

        -   BDVWriter with extended API
