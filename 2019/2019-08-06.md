    -   [<u>Devspace</u>](https://py3-ci.openmicroscopy.org/jenkins) now
        > available. New repositories include:

        -   With code:
            > [<u>omero-python-superbuild</u>](https://github.com/ome/omero-python-superbuild),
            > [<u>omero-py</u>](https://github.com/ome/omero-py)

        -   Still without code:

            > [<u>omero-dropbox</u>](https://github.com/ome/omero-dropbox)

    -   Initial target: assess whether OMERO.py (and web) could be

        -   If doable, migrate all Python PRs towards decoupled

            > taking precedence over the installed server

    -   Upcoming: further splitting including integration tests

        -   New repository coming. Considering splitting them by package
            > to parallelize the tests execution and reduce the total
