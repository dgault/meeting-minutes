2. Project Status
-----------------

(2-3 minutes each)

-   Summer epics

    -   Import / Thumbnail loading (Riad)

        -   if the import requires, check import has completed before
            > attempting to load thumbnail (possibly using “jobs”)

        -   Add more server/client messages to provide information to
            > users on progress of import

        -   Add extra UI to display any errors when a user selects an
            > image that’s failed to load, possibly new section to right
            > panel or a dialog,

        -   Trial changes on insight and see what functionality we can
            > add to blitz for similar use in web & CLI

        -   Milestone: 5.4.8 (end of the month)

        -   Suzanne’s (external contributor) importer work needs to be
            > reviewed for generality, to be discussed later

            -   Attaching complex metadata at import time (IDR use
                > cases?)

        -   There’s some other import document with more
            > information/ideas

            -   Some ideas for speed ups but not straightforward, more
                > discussions required

            -   Start scoping and estimating time requirements

    -   OME-TIFF pyramids (Seb)

        -   Aim: Use BF converter tools to convert all pyramidal file
            > formats in our possession into OME-TIFF pyramids, then
            > compare imports of original and OME pyramids

        -   Will likely affect CI servers

    -   ITR (Simon)

        -   Will be deployed this week

        -   Notebooks and docker image updated

        -   Preliminary test framework for notebooks

    -   Training

        -   Preparing for Basel

    -   App releases

        -   Figure: Bug in open PR, may affect release date

        -   Parade

-   Glencoe (Chris)

    -   OMERO PRs open, including fix for file handle leakage, and
        > improved documentation

    -   More microservice work, including integrating Prometheus metrics

-   Community

    -   [<u>Mike
        > Wicks</u>](https://www.ed.ac.uk/pathology/people/staff-students/mike-wicks)
        > visiting/presenting on August 21 to discuss Comparative
        > Pathology Workbench (CPW)

        -   Part of HCA/CZI project, building digital pathology
            > prototype app on top of OMERO, aim is to provide a web UI
            > for pathologists to browse and select data

        -   May benefit from reusing Figure work

    -   HCA: submission definition (Josh)

        -   Forget everything about writing a SpaceTX reader

        -   Instead use BFconvert to generate companion file and tiff
            > stack, which in conjunction with their JSON metadata
            > (which will have to be stored somewhere) equals SpaceTX

        -   Therefore every HCA image with be an OME file, though on S3
            > object store which will affect how OMERO reads the images

    -   Japan/Riken: SSDB channel available along with Google Drive
        > folders. Potential federation proposal

    -   More training sessions ….

3. AOB
------

(5 min. max; tech. Discussion should be highlighted to relevant people
and rescheduled)

-   ImageJ and CellProfiler are moving their forums to Discourse.
    > Probably not suitable for OME at the moment.

4. Main Topic
