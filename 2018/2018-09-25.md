2. Project Status
-----------------

(2-3 minutes each)

-   (Summer?) Epics

    -   OMERO 5.4.8: *whew*

        -   Done!

        -   OME production servers still need to be upgraded

    -   No decision yet on 5.4.9

-   Data In (Seb)

    -   Bio-Formats 6.0.0 roadmap

        -   M1: lots of non API breaking changes, KLB reader (required
            > for an IDR submission)

        -   M2: OME-TIFF pyramid reading/writing (feedback by tomorrow
            > morning)

        -   No more 5.9 releases planned, 5.10 will be released only if
            > high demand

    -   IDR 0.5.2

        -   Working on batch of 1000 antibodies from HPA (500K 3Kx3K
            > images)

            -   Annotations and rendering settings in progress

        -   New submission with image and ROI data including work on
            > relaxed companion OME-TIFF

    -   HCA (Josh)

        -   s3-reader prototype

            -   Aiming for a prototype repo to allow us to read a format
                > such as OME-TIFF over S3

            -   Main area of investigation will be latency of requests

-   Data Out (Mark)

    -   Collecting some initial thoughts in
        > [<u>gdoc</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11UQQS6oaM81TKUi05QZ0DXDdQWOq_PPNZtKIF5wJ-n4/edit),
        > certainly glad of suggestions, comments, redirection, etc.
        > before turning those notes into a Trello board.

    -   Turning omero-downloader into something that can be released to
        > users

        -   Current effort is to try to remove use of deprecated
            > [<u>OmeroReader</u>](https://github.com/openmicroscopy/openmicroscopy/blob/v5.4.8/components/blitz/src/loci/ome/io/OmeroReader.java)
            > from
            > [<u>omero-downloader</u>](https://gitlab.com/openmicroscopy/incubator/omero-downloader);
            > initial results seem promising. There are other small
            > technical fixes to be made to the proof-of-concept
            > downloader code before improving how it writes the
            > structured data to make it a production tool but perhaps
            > we want to go in a wholly different direction.

    -   More input on requirements welcome

    -   Petr: user in Australia has their own download script that
        > should be public somewhere, along with several annotation
        > scripts that might be interesting

    -   Josh: another use case would be slurping from IDR as g. did.

    -   Simon: potentially a demo? Sure, or some brief summary (docs?)

-   Training (JM):

    -   Upcoming Neubias meeting **Edinburgh**

    -   Potential workshop in **Finland** in November

    -   **Heidelberg** workshop in December

    -   **Cambridge** training in December

    -   **Singapore** workshop next year

-   Web apps:

    -   Will: preparing a handover of projects

    -   JM: Preparing minor release of OMERO.figure

    -   JM: Testing FPBioimage improvements

-   Glencoe (Chris)

    -   5.4.8 testing, found some thumbnail bugs, probably related to
        > read-only server, aiming to write integration tests

        -   JM: may be related to known bugs

        -   Riad: working on some open-source thumbnail integration
            > tests too

    -   Bug found with administrator sessions in OMERO.web

    -   Doing some computer vision work with whole slide images,
        > including new/updated file formats. Some work will be
        > backported.

    -   Webinar next Tuesday

-   Community (Josh)

    -   RDF Love 💙💚❤️
