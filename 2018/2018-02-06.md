3. AOB
------

(5 min. max; tech. Discussion should be highlighted to relevant people
and rescheduled)

-   

4. Kubernetes presentation by Simon
-----------------------------------

(20-25 minutes plus 15 minutes questions max)

-   Container orchestration

    -   What, why, any bad?

-   Kubernetes - open souce container orchestration etc.

-   Containers - lightweight form of virtualisation

    -   Methodology for packaging and shipping

    -   Docker: platform and tools for building and running apps

-   OMERO in Docker - e.g 4 containers

    -   Postres, Server, Web, Nginx

-   Manually: $ docker run (x 4)

-   Easier: docker-compose

-   OMERO at scale: Redis, Multiple OMERO.web, Web-apps, OMERO.scripts,
    > JupyterHub etc.

-   Solutions:

    -   Run containers on different hosts

    -   Automatically schedule containers across different hosts.

    -   Tools: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos,

-   Kubernetes is great because:

    -   Schedule applications across multiple servers based on
        > constraints

    -   Infrastructure as code - version controlled

    -   Automatically restart failed/slow applications - e.g. Health
        > check ping of OMERO.web

    -   Automatically move applications off a failed server - e.g.
        > power-cut

    -   Provide a service directory. (instead of manual docs for jobs
        > etc)

-   Microservices - 10s - 100s of copies

-   Kubernetes model:

    -   Pods - containerised app, e.g OMERO.web

    -   Deployments - manages one or more Pods

    -   Services - the interface to a deployment. E.g. provides
        > load-balancing

    -   Service Discovery - DNS provides named-based lookup of services

-   Debugging multiple containers:

    -   use centralised logging

    -   Use Traceable identifiers

-   Need shared data store to handle failure of services

-   Kubernetes vv Docker swarm. - almost same features, Kubernetes been
    > around longer

-   Simon - devspace mixes containers - no clean separation of data vv
    > stateless containers

-   Josh - devspace is too much for some usages - e.g Just server & data

-   Chris - running Kubernetes is too much investment for most of our
    > users

-   Jason - flagship projects will need this

-   Simon/Balaji - important how we develop the app (regardless of the
    > platform)

-   Chris - and the problems remain (logging, shared storage, …) even if
    > using unix services

-   JRS - asking the community if anyone would be interested (Brisbane,
    > Allen, …)

-   Josh - something more formalised than docker-compose would be nice
    > for our users

    -   Internally - team needs to understand usage

-   Kenny: Helm (kubernetes package manager) - Helm charts are like
    > package file

    -   E.g. running a Helm chart on amazon is very easy.

    -   Currently setting up Kubernetes cluster “lochy”

    -   First app is Redmine

    -   JM: Training server

-   Petr - time to swap DB (the data) has been the problem (spinning up
    > the devspace is easy)
