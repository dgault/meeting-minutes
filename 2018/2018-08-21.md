2. Project Status
-----------------

(2-3 minutes each)

-   Summer epics

    -   Import (Josh)

        -   Merging ongoing, into develop.

        -   Existing work: logs, metrics, Insight GUI PR

        -   Upcoming: no default thumbnails, parallel import CLI

        -   Few other miscellaneous PRs (channel color, etc)

        -   5.4.8 RC build targeted for 31st of August (Friday)

        -   Various testing necessary

        -   Careful to test all Insight & BF changes

        -   JM: Help docs screenshots need updating (useful for
            > workshops, esp if no time to demo import)

            -   Basel: doing import (don’t need help)

            -   Sydney: no import → need help

            -   Okinawa: probably not

            -   Kobe: perhaps

        -   Jason: thanks for summer work on import

        -   Discussed holding back release for more import work.

        -   JM: Some docs PRs

    -   IDR (Dom)

        -   Prod51 set up by Seb

        -   Idr0041 currently being reannotated on prod51 (Seb)

        -   Idr0043 (HPA) - 15TB, 500,000 images: Still trying to import
            > on idr-testing. Now uses %hash% instead of %timestamp% for
            > directory names to avoid clashes when importing in
            > parallel. Import with “skip all”. But still latest import
            > attempt just failed again.

        -   OMERO might cope better with images in Plates? Single
            > fileset? etc.

        -   Idr0045: Going to import on prod51 when idr0041 reannotation
            > is finished. Still waiting for genotype annotation from
            > J-K, but can be added later in case it’s too late for idr
            > 0.5.1 release.

    -   Mail (Kenny): New mailman server:

        -   Testing mailing lists with spam filtering. Reply/Reply-all
            > behaviour changed. Seems to be working OK over last week.

        -   Mailman upgrade would require new server, but not
            > necessarily a bad thing.

        -   Approx 2-weeks’ work.

        -   One option: Use google mail. Or outsource to Mailman
            > provider

            -   Jason: Longterm stable provider? Archiving?

            -   Prefer ome ‘branding’ instead of google.ome etc.

            -   Discourse? (IJ etc)

            -   Josh: Mailman is ‘easiest’ (what we know how to do).
                > Usability vv google

            -   Could investigate cost of moving to Discourse?

        -   Kenny: will look at branding of Google services, and our own
            > Mailman

    -   Training:

        -   New public alternative jupyterhub server.

        -   Backup server since Jupyter notebooks are critical to
            > workshops

        -   New www.ome/training pages and ome/apps page

        -   Jason: ITR (Eurobioimaging deliverable) is nice bridge
            > between IDR and training work. JM: recently added Trakmate

    -   \#hca (Josh): still waiting on real data.

        -   Will go in \_from\_hca directory.

        -   While waiting can work on validation, then time to ramp up
            > the S3 work.

        -   Reading TIFFs from S3. Various options re: performance.

(5 min. max; tech. Discussion should be highlighted to relevant people
and rescheduled)

4. Main Topic
-------------

(20-25 minutes plus 15 minutes questions max)

-   Mike Wicks - EDU

-   Comparative Pathology Workbench (CPW)

-   HCA (Human Cell Atlas) CZI-funded project, 6-8 Sub Areas

-   CPW: Scienc-y bit (conceptual coordinate model of the small and
    > large intestine (not discussed today)

-   Who? Mark Arends (PI), Richard Baldock (consultant, models & tools),
    > Albert Berger. (mapping model, bioinformatics).

-   Objectives:

    -   Prototype for pathologists

    -   To Visualise, Arrange, “Annotate”, Analyse their data

    -   Share dta with other pathologists

-   Grid/Matrix presentation of Data

-   Before: rows “meant” something. E.g. Mouse / histopathology etc.

-   Now: Completely freeform grid - anything goes anywhere - user can
    > choos.

-   Functionality of CPW (typical Pathologist’s workflow)

    -   Biuild a matrix or matrices

    -   Assign data to cells - 1 image per cell

    -   Share matrix

    -   Collaborative comments

-   What Data is in a CPW cell? Mostly Images, hence OMERO.

    -   Histopathology

        -   Image - Microscope

    -   Radiology

        -   Image - X-ray. Format?

    -   Genomic

        -   Host Images

        -   ROIs

    -   Blogging Engine? - collaborative commentary

    -   OMERO flattened tree

    -   Of interest to OME..?

-   Integration with OMERO

    -   Authentication

    -   Annotation

    -   Avoid Reinventing the wheel

-   Collaborative Opportunities:

    -   New metaphor for organising OMERO data?
