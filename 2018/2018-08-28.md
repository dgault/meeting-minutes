        -   Anyone other upcoming work?

            -   Kenny: light-admin icon?

                -   Push to 5.x.x if the card’s in the 5.4.8 backlog.

            -   Susanne’s instrument PR probably requires some work on
                > our side. Push to 5.4.9?

        -   Jean-Marie: testing for Dom’s UI changes

            -   Petr: capture new features in scenarios eventually.

            -   More worried about cancel all

        -   Will: few cards in 5.4.8. None of them are essential.
